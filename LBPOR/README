## Required:
* Linux (test on Ubuntu 16.04)
* Install gcc (g++) that supports -std=c++14 
* Install gmp and mpfr
* Install NFLlib (https://github.com/quarkslab/NFLlib)
* Edit the makefile (the first two lines) to have:
	NFLLIB_HOME: the directory where you have installed nfllib
	LIBS_HOME  : the directory where you have installed gmp and mpfr


## To compile:
* Compile: make -Ibuild
* Run test : make -Ibuild run


## Test scenario of LBPOR scheme (the default is 128-bit security):
* The default parameters are in the params.hpp file
* The test scenario is in the main.cpp file


## We include the built test in the default test scenario in bin. To run, use the command 'make -Ibuild run'

## Related file description:
* LBPOR.cpp and LBPOR.hpp provides all algorithm implementations in LBPOR scheme, and provide interfaces for scenario testing.
* shake.cpp and shake.h is used to implement SHAKE128/SHAKE256. 
* fast_fft.cpp and fast_fft.hpp is used for FFT operation among polynomials in the perturbation vector sampling (SampleP) algorithm of SamplePre.  
* gaussian.cpp and gaussian.hpp provide the sampling algorithm of G-trapdoor (SampleG) and SampleP algorithm required in SamplePre of our scheme.
* gaussian_sign.cpp and gaussian_sign.hpp provide the SampleG and SampleP algorithm required in SamplePre of the signature scheme.
