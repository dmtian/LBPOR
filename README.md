Proofs of Retrievability with Public Verifiability from Lattices
============================================
The experimental evaluation procedures presented in this paper are as follows.

## Description of folders:
* LBPOR: Contains the implementation of our scheme. The source code is located in the LBPOR/src/ directory. The prerequisites and compilation instructions for testing are provided in the LBPOR/README file.
* External_library: Includes all external libraries required for the aforementioned implementations.

## External libraries:
* gmp-6.1.2.tar.lz: Installation package for the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library (GMP), used to perform various operations on large integers.
* mpfr-4.0.1.tar.gz: Installation package for the GNU MPFR library, which is a prerequisite for installing NFLlib.
* NFLlib-master.zip: Installation package for the NTT-based Fast Lattice library, utilized for fast polynomial operations over rings
